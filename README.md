## Mini-Bank App

## Key requirement: 

1. A login page, which authenticates a user through the Plaid API Plaid's API authenticates users using their banking credentials and pulls in all their banking transaction data. Make sure your login page includes the necessary fields to pull in the transaction history.
You should be using the sandbox credentials to make the appropriate API call to retrieve all the data necessary to complete the task.

2. A dashboard/homepage or pages to display the data. You should display both relevant account data and transaction data per account.
Display the data in any way you choose, the goal is to show the history of transactions and the data relevant to a user.

3.  A way to sort the transaction data There should be a feature to sort the data in ways that you find relevant to a user. We hope that you will use any knowledge of product or UX to embellish on this portion of the task.
